This week I worked on my website by ading the folder urls and finsihed working on the screen. I had a little trouble moving the folder links to the right possition on the screen, but eventually i figured it out. I also put a backgrouond on the screen. The last thing a tried to do but failed was adding a picture of a pc and wires to make it look like it is powering the screen. 


Today I was able to arragnge the folder image pc correctly. The reason it was not working becuase I had not labeled the image as absoulute so it was not able to move around. I also had not set the pixels placements correctly

This class I started my christmas project for my parents. When you click on a key it adds ornaments and then finally the star on top of the tree. I was able to get the base of the code, but when I tried to complete the array it didnt quite, work and their were some errors in the console. I eventually fixed the errors in the console, but it still doesn't work. Im going to try and fix that next class. 

Molly helped my try something new with my project. In stead of doing and array of different obects, i made a fucntion so that when I click anywhere on the tree the same ornament apears. I also added a hover animation on the top of the tree. When you hover over the top a star will start to apear and then glow.


Last class we started off with making a background color generator, although i did not really understand how the code worked, i sort of understood the process it was doing. Today i had tried to finish what I was doing but I still did not under stand it well enough. Molly helped me with it and my ordering of some things were wrong and eventually it worked. It was a project when wherever you hover you curser affects how much red and green there is in the background color.
