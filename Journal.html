This week I worked on my website by ading the folder urls and finsihed working on the screen. I had a little trouble moving the folder links to the right possition on the screen, but eventually i figured it out. I also put a backgrouond on the screen. The last thing a tries to do but failed was adding a picture of a pc and wires to make it look like it is powering the screen.
